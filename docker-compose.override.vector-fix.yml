# Fix for Windows Docker Desktop bug where bind-mounted files appear as directories
# Mount the entire /etc/vector directory instead of individual file
# Path is relative to first compose file (supabase/docker/), so ../../ = project root

services:
  vector:
    volumes:
      # Mount our directory containing vector.yml to /etc/vector
      - ../../vector-config:/etc/vector
      - ${DOCKER_SOCKET_LOCATION}:/var/run/docker.sock:ro,z

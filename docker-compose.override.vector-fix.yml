# Fix for Windows Docker Desktop bug where bind-mounted files appear as directories
# This override replaces the vector.yml bind mount with our own file from project root
# Docker Compose replaces volumes with matching target paths (not merge)

services:
  vector:
    volumes:
      # Same target path as original - this REPLACES the supabase bind mount
      - ./vector.yml:/etc/vector/vector.yml:ro
      - ${DOCKER_SOCKET_LOCATION}:/var/run/docker.sock:ro,z
